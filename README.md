# addListviewPointers

If your listview on mobile device is very long and it takes more than a screen height you might be lost on your location. 

With the code you can add indicators/pointing arrows to be shown if whole screen seen.

On click 'TOP' arrow you are being taken at the very top of the list, and the 'BOTTOM' one opposite.

It intercepts your accurare location and hides not needed arrow if there's no need using one.
